Digital CV for Springboard Foundations
Design and develop an HTML webpage that acts as your digital CV.

# Requirements

1. **Originality and Authenticity of the Content**: Your CV should be a genuine reflection of your journey and skills. While we provide sample content, sample output, and a solution, these are for guidance only. Use our examples as inspiration, but ensure your content, structure, and design are authentic and not mere copies.
2. **Utilization of HTML Elements**: Include the following at minimum:
    - **Headers**: Denote section titles and sub-titles (from `h1` to `h6`). Use at least until `h3` (included).
    - **Lists**: Wrap list items. Implement both ordered (`ol`) and unordered (`ul`) lists where appropriate, for instance, for listing out skills or educational qualifications.
    - **Hyperlinks**: Connect pages, which can be used for referencing your projects on GitHub or linking to your LinkedIn profile.
    - **Images**: Integrate a profile picture image.
3. **Utilization of Semantic Structuring**: Use semantic HTML tags to logically structure your CV content. This not only makes your CV readable by browsers but also improves accessibility for screen readers.
4. **Diverse Sections**: Incorporate at least 3 distinct sections in your CV. While you need at least 3, adding more can provide a comprehensive view of your profile. Possible sections are summary, education, skills, achievements, work experience, and projects.
5. **Using Comments**: Incorporate comments in your HTML code to:
    - Highlight the purpose of specific sections.
    - Explain the rationale behind a certain structure or element choice.
    - Leave notes for future modifications.
6. **Attributing Help**:
    - If you incorporate code or inspiration from online resources, attribute the source. At a minimum, provide the URL.
    - If you get help from mentors or TAs, describe the help given and attribute the name.
